## Dataset Generation
Two types of datasets were generated for this project:

### Dataset 1
- Generated based on the student ID (1211101555)
- Six different datasets of varying sizes: 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 250,000, and 500,000
- Used for sorting algorithm analysis

### Dataset 2
- Generated based on the sum of other group members' student IDs (3633305231)
- Represents a graph with stars as nodes and distances between stars as edges
- Used for graph algorithms and dynamic programming problems

## Sorting Algorithms
Two sorting algorithms were implemented and analyzed:

### Heap Sort
- Implementation using a priority queue
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1) for in-place sorting, O(n) using priority queue

### Selection Sort
- Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm
- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

Both algorithms were tested on Dataset 1, and their performance was compared across different dataset sizes.

## Graph Algorithms
Two graph algorithms were implemented using Dataset 2:

### Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)
- Finds the shortest paths from a source star to all other stars
- Time Complexity: O((n + m) log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n + m)

### Kruskal's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- Finds the minimum spanning tree of the star graph
- Time Complexity: O(m log m)
- Space Complexity: O(n + m)

Where n is the number of stars/vertices and m is the number of edges.

## Dynamic Programming
The 0/1 Knapsack problem was solved using dynamic programming:

### 0/1 Knapsack
- Maximizes the total profit of items (stars) placed in a knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity
- Time Complexity: O(nW)
- Space Complexity: O(nW)

Where n is the number of stars and W is the maximum weight capacity.
